# This is second task of rust bootcamp

## Task Details

    - Create an enum called Operation with variants Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide. Each variant should hold two f64 values.
    - Create a function called calculate that takes an Operation enum as an argument and returns an f64 result.
    - Implement the calculate function using pattern matching to perform the appropriate arithmetic operation based on the variant of the Operation enum.
    - In the main function, prompt the user to input the first number, the operation to be performed, and the second number.
    - Parse the user input into appropriate variables.
    - Create an Operation enum instance with the parsed input values.
    - Call the calculate function with the created Operation enum instance.
    - Print the result to the console.
    - Compile and run the program to ensure it works as expected.
